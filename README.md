# Arise My Minions

Arise My Minions is a mod about capturing and breeding the souls of mobs. It's currently in the very early stages of development, so expect bugs and placeholder GUIs to abound. When it's finished, this mod will allow you to:

* Capture the souls of mobs in a soulstone.
* Spawn mobs by placing soulstones into a *clay effigy*.
* Breed souls together using mendelian inheritance, allowing you to crossbreed traits from one mob to another.
* Mutate mob souls to create new kinds of mob that can't be encountered naturally, unlocking new drops and other possibilities.

# Dependencies

This mod depends on the following libraries:

* [Cardinal Components API](https://github.com/OnyxStudios/Cardinal-Components-API)
